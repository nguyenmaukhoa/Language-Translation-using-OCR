# Blink-Detector-with-OpenCV

In this project, we use facial landmark detection to detect eye blink. Detecting facial landmarks such as the eyes, nose, and mouth is a natural extension to performing face detection since the bounding box for a face represents a natural starting point for detecting facial landmarks. 

Detecting facial landmarks has numerous applications including drowsy driver detection, emotion detection, virtual makeup, and HCI applications to ease communication for disabled people, to name a few. Facial feature detection is also referred to as “facial landmark detection”, “facial keypoint detection”, and “face alignment”
